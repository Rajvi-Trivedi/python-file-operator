# Personal Journal Manager (Python File Handling System)

## Project Overview

Personal Journal Manager is a console-based Python application designed to manage journal entries using file-based storage.

The system allows users to create, retrieve, search, and delete journal records through a structured, menu-driven interface. It demonstrates practical implementation of file handling, exception management, and object-oriented programming concepts.

## Objective

The project focuses on:

* Implementing persistent data storage using text files
* Applying structured file operations (read, write, append, delete)
* Designing a class-based architecture
* Handling runtime exceptions for reliable execution
* Building an interactive console application

---

## Key Functionalities

### Add Entry

* Appends new journal entries to a file
* Automatically attaches timestamps
* Ensures persistent storage

### View Entries

* Displays all stored entries
* Handles missing file scenarios gracefully

### Search Entries

* Keyword and date-based search
* Case-insensitive matching
* Displays filtered results only

### Delete Journal

* Deletes the journal file after confirmation
* Prevents accidental removal

### Exit System

* Controlled and clean application termination

---

## Technical Implementation

* File handling using `open()`
* File existence validation
* OS module integration
* Date-time formatting
* Try–except exception handling
* Class-based system design
* Menu-driven navigation

---

## System Highlights

* Persistent file-based storage
* Structured object-oriented design
* Error handling for stable execution
* Clean separation of responsibilities
* Practical simulation of a lightweight record management system

---

## Future Improvements

* Entry-level encryption for privacy
* Selective entry deletion
* JSON-based structured storage
* User authentication layer
* GUI or web-based interface
* Date-range filtering
